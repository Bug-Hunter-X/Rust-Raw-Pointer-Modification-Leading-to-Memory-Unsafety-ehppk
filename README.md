This repository demonstrates a common error in Rust: directly manipulating memory pointed to by a raw pointer after creating a mutable reference to the same data.  The original code attempts to modify a vector's elements using a raw pointer, which can lead to undefined behavior due to potential changes in the vector's internal structure. The solution provides a safer way to modify the vector elements.
